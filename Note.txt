Description: this is a note about how to rewriting url in apache2 php in linux OS

Firstly, you need to enable mod_rewrite in your apache2 server by following command on Debian/Linux:
a2enmod rewrite

Secondly, allowing read .htaccess file in your /etc/apache2/apache2.conf file, adding some line init file, below part "AccessFileName .htaccess":

<Directory /var/www/*>
                Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
                AllowOverride All
                Order allow,deny
                allow from all
</Directory>

We need to add some lines because it will allow for server read your .htaccess file for rewriting url.

After all, restart your apache2 server by using the command below:

service apache2 restart

It is all things needed to do before creating a .htaccess file for rewriting url.

Now, I will take you an example about rewriting url: 
In my directory, I have a product.php file, it had the following content:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Product php</title>
</head>

<body>
<?php
        echo "Product id: " . $_GET["pid"] . "!" . "<br />";
        echo "Time: " .$_GET["time"] . "!";
?>
</body>
</html>

I place it under the directory /var/www/ProgrammingGroup/product.php. This php file will take two getting parameters and display them to users, those are: pid and time. A accessing url like that:

http://localhost/ProgrammingGroup/product.php?pid=1&time=10

Or whatever value you placed for them. So how to rewriting the directory to:

http://localhost/ProgrammingLanguage/1/10
It equals to: http://localhost/ProgrammingGroup/product.php?pid=1&time=10

It also your question here. My answering is using .htaccess for that. In your example, you need to create a .htaccess in the directory: /var/www/ProgrammingGroup/ and place the following text init:

<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
        RewriteEngine On
        RewriteBase /ProgrammingGroup/

        RewriteRule ^([a-zA-Z0-9]+)/([a-zA-Z0-9]+)$ product.php?pid=$1&time=$2
</IfModule>

Or just simple like that:

RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /ProgrammingGroup/

RewriteRule ^([a-zA-Z0-9]+)/([a-zA-Z0-9]+)$ product.php?pid=$1&time=$2

How does it work?

I will explain this:

Turn your rewrite mode by: "RewriteEngine On" line

The "RewriteBase /ProgrammingGroup/" is the base directory for all rewriting rules

And the rule is defined that: 
RewriteRule ^([a-zA-Z0-9]+)/([a-zA-Z0-9]+)$ product.php?pid=$1&time=$2

It means searching until meet $ and the first "([a-zA-Z0-9]+)" for pid and the second "([a-zA-Z0-9]+)" for time parameter. Check all character from a -> z, A -> Z and the number from 0 -> 9 for value of two parameters. And replace accessing url is: 

product.php?pid=$1&time=$2

with $1 exchange for the first and $2 exchange for the second.

As I revoled above, it is not about the code. It is almost about RegEx(or regular expression), master your knowledge about RegEx. You can create the expected rules you want

Well, it is very clear. Finally, I hope you will understand
